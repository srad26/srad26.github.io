## Herbaceous Peony Breeding

![](IMG_8767.jpg){width="5in"}

In early 2020 I made a career move from working in a clinical molecular biology lab to working as a gardener. From the outside, it might have appeared to be a surprising move, but really I felt it was moving me closer to my passion and to the work I began in my undergraduate studies. By 2021 I was so enamored with all I was learning, that I decided to apply to graduate school and pursue plant science as a career.

It really all started for me in this field of peonies. This field contained well over 100 varieties of herbaceous peonies that descended from the once world's-largest peony supplier, the [Brand Peony Farm](https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=212095) est. 1868. I walked the fields and learned the names and nuance of every variety I could. I started to see so much variation in the color and structure of the foliage and the petals, and was able to pick up on desirable characteristics.

Each fall I would help to dig the plants from the field, dissect them with a sharp blade, and ship them all around the country to fellow peony collectors. I saw the difference in root structure and growth rates for different varieties, and of course I squirreled away any roots that were destined for the compost for safe-keeping.

While my professional work focuses on soybean, I still maintain a modest collection of 20 varieties that traveled to Missouri with me. I spend my springs planning crosses and nursing my collection to continue their growth over the years. Peonies are known to live up to 100 years and thrive in neglect, so I believe my efforts in their early stages of development will outlast me and be left for future ornamental breeders to utilize.
